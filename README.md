# Advanced JavaScript Practice

This repository demonstrates my hands-on practice with **core and advanced JavaScript concepts**.  
Each file focuses on a specific topic that helps strengthen my understanding of how JavaScript works under the hood.

## 💡 Topics Covered

- Function arguments and parameters  
- Array manipulation (`slice`, `splice`, `join`, `map`, `filter`, `find`)  
- Loops and control flow (`break`, `continue`)  
- Closures and lexical scope  
- `==` vs `===` comparison  
- `null` vs `undefined`  
- Object property access and iteration  
- Scope and hoisting  
- Truthy and falsy values
